# PinkAware ‚Äî An Inclusive Platform for Breast Cancer Detection & Support

## Inspiration
One of the major challenges related to breast cancer is late detection. If detected early, many lives can be saved. Unfortunately, conventional diagnostic methods are often inaccessible, especially in remote or underprivileged areas.

This inspired us to build **PinkAware** ‚Äî a comprehensive and inclusive platform that not only aids in early detection of breast cancer using ultrasound imaging and machine learning, but also provides end-to-end support throughout the patient's medical journey.
